--- ideas ---
1. turn action["effect"] into a list to encourage continuous questions about the same object
2. normalize the cosine similarity over all elements in memory and multiply it with its array position
-> recent additions should be valued higher
3. add CreatorLLM which creates a new game object through json definition
