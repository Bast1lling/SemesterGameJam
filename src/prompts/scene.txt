Now here is your task:
You need to respond to the user input by the following structure:
1) Parameter "action": You need to figure out what the user wants to do in the scene. Therefore, choose exactly the single action from the set described above which matches the user's intention. If you are not sure, instead choose the "failure" action!
2) Parameter "description": A text response describing the outcome of the player's action and the new state of the game, or answering the question proposed by the action.
Always keep in mind what the player knows at the time of the request. Do never give him information when he did not ask for it or let him act by just randomly guessing.
It is really important that you provide BOTH parameters when calling the function
