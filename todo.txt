TODO:
1. player should have knowledge base where all facts he already knows are written down
-> a fact is a piece of story
-> a new fact is added on account of a specialized llm
-> llm: current user input i, current model response o, knowledge base k -> fact f
2. refactor llm:
-> one llm, multiple modes like scene, character, story
-> base class prompts are initialized with all possible prompt parts
-> add functionality to prompter to mix prompt parts according to input structure
-> move llm to story class
3. conversation state:
-> expand available actions to charm, anger, etc.

FUTURE FEATURES
1. let llm determine scene welcome message based on knowledge base
2. add items
3. add multithreaded llm querying
4. add LLama3 support
