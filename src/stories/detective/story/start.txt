You are in a large, sumptuous dining room. There is nothing but silver cutlery on the expansive table and a chandelier dangles from the ceiling. But actually, that's not the only thing dangling from the ceiling.
The player is the detective Jan ver Bindung, who is world-famous for his extraordinary powers of deduction. This time, too, his mission is extraordinary: to shed light on a mysterious death. The head of the Dutch national police has been found dead in his villa. The autopsy has already ruled it a suicide. But is this really true or can Bindung perhaps connect the missing dots here? Currently, he has entered the dining room where the body still is dangling from the chandelier. Apparently he hanged himself...
